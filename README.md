# 🚀 Coding Journey: Shalin Christian 

"Building, learning, and occasionally debugging until it works."

[cite_start]Currently an **MCA Student** at CHARUSAT [cite: 7, 40][cite_start], I’m using this space to document my path from a **BCA graduate** [cite: 8, 42] to a creator of useful web tools. I’m not a pro yet, but I’m a high-speed learner with a deep interest in how the web works under the hood.

### 🧪 What’s Cooking in the Lab?
I’m currently exploring the bridge between **.NET** and the **MEAN stack**.
- [cite_start]🛠️ Modernizing my logic with **C#** and **ASP.NET Core**[cite: 10, 17].
- [cite_start]🌐 Experimenting with **JavaScript** and **Angular** to make things look less like "developer UI"[cite: 10].
- [cite_start]💾 Diving into **MongoDB** and **SQL** to keep my data organized[cite: 10, 32, 34].

### 🏗️ Projects I've Messed With
- [cite_start]**UserConnect**: A playground for learning CRUD operations with **ASP.NET** and **SQL Server**[cite: 17, 18].
- [cite_start]**Nestify**: My first deep dive into **PHP** and **MySQL** to handle property listings and email flows[cite: 14, 15].
